# Lf for VSCode


This is an extension that allows you to open [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) by gokcehan in your VSCode instance.


## Commands and Settings

```jsonc
{
  "command": "lf.open",
  "settings": {
    "lf.command": "lf",
    "lf.focusCommand": "$lf -remote \"send $id select ${file}\"",
    "lf.openInEditor": false
  }
}
```

## WSL

I have some special configurations in WSL to make it work with the windows / linux paths.

```bash
# custom select with filepath check
cmd sel ${{
    if [ "$1" ]; then
        path="$1"
        if [[ "$path" =~ ^[a-zA-Z]: ]]; then
            path=$(wslpath "$path")
        fi
        lf -remote "send $id select '$path'"
    fi
}}
```

```jsonc
// this should normally check whether a windows path is given and then converts it with wslpath
"lf.command": "p=\"${file}\"; [[ \"$p\" =~ ^[a-zA-Z]: ]] && p=$(wslpath \"$p\") && lf $p || lf $p",

// custom select with filepath check
"lf.focusCommand": ":sel \"${file}\"",
```
